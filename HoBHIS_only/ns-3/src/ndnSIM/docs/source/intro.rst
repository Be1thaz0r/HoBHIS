Introduction
============

The ndnSIM is NS-3 module that implements Named Data Networking (NDN) communication model, the clean slate Internet design. ndnSIM is specially optimized for simulation purposes and has a cleaner and more extensible internal structure comparing to the existing NDN implementation (Project CCNx).

Following the NDN architecture, ndnSIM is implemented as a new network-layer protocol model, which can run on top of any available link-layer protocol model (point-to-point, CSMA, wireless, etc.).

.. note::
    It will also be possible to run ndnSIM on top of network-layer (IPv4, IPv6) and transport-layer (TCP, UDP) protocols.
    However, it is not yet implemented and patches are welcome.

.. This flexibility allows ndnSIM to simulate scenarios of various homogeneous and heterogeneous networks (e.g., NDN-only, NDN-over-IP, etc.).

The simulator is implemented in a modular fashion, using separate C++ classes to model behavior of each network-layer entity in NDN: :ndnsim:`pending Interest table (PIT) <Pit>`, :ndnsim:`forwarding information base (FIB) <Fib>`, :ndnsim:`content store <ContentStore>`, :ndnsim:`network <NetDeviceFace>` and :ndnsim:`application <AppFace>` interfaces, :ndnsim:`Interest forwarding strategies <ForwardingStrategy>`, etc.
This modular structure allows any component to be easily modified or replaced with no or minimal impact on other components.
In addition, the simulator provides an extensive collection of interfaces and helpers to perform detailed tracing behavior of every component, as well as NDN traffic flow.

The wire format of Interest and Data packets follows the format of the existing `CCNx Project's NDN implementation`_ (CCNx Binary Encoding), allowing reuse of the existing traffic analysis tools, as well as driving simulations using real NDN traffic traces.

Logging
-------

Almost every component in ndnSIM exports logging interface, so in debug compilation it is possible to track many internal details. 
For example, logging of :ndnsim:`Face` and :ndnsim:`Consumer` shows everything what happens in :ndnsim:`Face` and :ndnsim:`Consumer` classes::

    NS_LOG=ndn.Face:ndn.Consumer ./waf --run=ndn-simple

Refer to the source code and NS-3 documentation to see what logging interfaces are available and about details how enable one or more logging interfaces.
