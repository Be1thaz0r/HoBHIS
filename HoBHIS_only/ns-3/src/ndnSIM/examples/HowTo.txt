You can find some example scripts of HoBHIS in files: hobhis-chain.cc and hobhis-fairness.cc

You can run the scripts with different parameters. To see the possible configurations ask the script for help in the following way:

./waf --run "hobhis-chain --PrintHelp"
./waf --run "hobhis-fairness --PrintHelp"

Example:

To run the script hobhis-chain with queue tracing you can do as follows:
